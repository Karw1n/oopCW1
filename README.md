# 371todo

You should use this README to document things you did that you thing are clever and could get you marks, or things you couldn't get working and perhaps why. It is fully expected that a lot of students will not complete this coursework—-it is designed to be challenging. The mark scheme is also designed to be fair—marks are awarded for everything you complete, with some given for the quality of the code you write.

During the development of the project I think I became more efficient with my code writing. Before this project I didn't
have the greatest understand on references and how best to use them but I think whilst coding I've developed a greater
understanding. This project was helpful as well as challenging, it has definetly strengthend my understanding of certain
topics.

In 371todo:
I created a helper function that splits the string of multiple tags into a string vector containing all the tags.

In Todolist:
Created the function getProjects() which returns the list of projects. This was needed for when I was trying to access
the list from outside the class.

In Project:
Created the function getTasks() which returns the list of tasks. This was needed for when I was trying to access
the list from outside the class.

In Task:
Created the function getTags() which returns the list of tags. This was needed for when I was trying to access
the list from outside the class.

In Date:
Date::setInitialised(bool initialised) - this function is to set the intitialised which I need for the delete action 
in 371todo.cpp.

I also created two helper functions that verify if a date is a valid date, which is used in the setDateFromString. I didn't
use it in setDate function as I wasn't sure if it was required to be checked as it wasn't mentioned in the specification.
Date::isValidDate(unsigned int year, unsigned int month, unsigned int day)
Date::isLeapYear(unsigned int year)


Overall I believe a succesfull coursework on my behalf. As per most autograder projects, tedious when it goes wrong, but
rewarding when it goes right. I think the daily limits were useful as well as having the test suites available. 

Happy marking!
